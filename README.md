# React Portfolio

Our task this week was to re-build our web development portfolio using React. My portfolio features an about me homepage, an online portfolio which includes some of the personal and group projects I have worked on during bootcamp, an online resume, a contact page and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile. There is also a downloadable CV as well. The portfolio is deployed on github pages.
